## Introduction
### Problem Description
Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport Model or STILT model is an atmospheric model that simulates air parcel movements using ensembles of particles starting from a particular time and location.  Although the model can run both forward and backward in time from the given starting location, the backward runs are more commonly used. The knowledge of air particle trajectories depends on the specified receptors, which are the locations that the measurements were made.  From the information obtained via STILT, one can construct the influence of an atmospheric observation, which has proven to be extremely useful for understanding atmospheric datasets. As the numbers of particles and receptors increase, the information of specific atmospheric datasets increases as well as the computational cost. Thus, the main challenge of using STILT is to come up with optimal numbers of receptors, numbers of particles, and the time that needs to be running backward for.

### The Needs for HPC and Big Data

## Test Cases Experiments

We use two cases with different computational profiles to investigate STILT parallelization. A memory-lightweight case serves as proof-of-concept and is intended to be easily parallelizable. A second case is memory-intensive and ...

A STILT run requires the following datasets to run: (i) an emission dataset, (ii) a meteorological dataset, (iii) a receptor dataset, and (iv) an R script. 

For the memory-light case, we used what has been provided on the official STILT site.

For the memory-intensive case, we used emission and receptor datasets based on a research project that studies greenhouse gas emissions in the New York City area. The meteorological product that we chose was the Global Forecast System. The meteorological reanalysis was from March 1st, 2019 https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs.
